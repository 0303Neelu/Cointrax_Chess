# Cointrax_Chess

I had created this project using the oops concepts in cpp and with the advanced graph datastructures. The aim of this project is to show the movings of the chess coins if the coins current place is given and the representation will be graphical representation using sfml library in cpp. It will work like if we give the starting position of a coin in the chess board like (0,0) means it will give the moves of the particular coin in the chess board with a highlighter.
